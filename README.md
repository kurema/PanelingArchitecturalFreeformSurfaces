# Paneling architectural freeform surfaces
This is implimentation of [Paneling architectural freeform surfaces - Eigensatz](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/149373/files/eigensatz_2010_PAF.pdf) on Rhino Common SDK.  
Use this on C# component on Grasshopper.

Currently, this **DOES NOT WORK** as expected. The problem seems to be on Gauss-Newton method, which is not my fault.
